                    <p>I am an engineer, web developer, educator, polyglot, and an philanthropist.
                         I grew up in Haiti, "Lapl√©n" - in a small town called "Karade" inside a small 
                         village called "Gran Chimen".<br></br> <br></br>
                    Mathematics and languages saved my life. 
                    During my career experience, I have worked with top smart people at Google, Lockheed 
                    Martin, and other major technology companies. <br></br> <br></br>
                    Also, I have visited and lived in about 25 countries. With this educational platform, 
                    I hope one day I can give back all the knowledge that I was given to my Haitian people.</p>
